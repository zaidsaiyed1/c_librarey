# C Library 
This is a **personal C library project** created to **organize and manage** all of my C code in one place.
It serves as a central repository where I store, reuse, and maintain various C programs, functions, and utilities that I’ve written over time.
The goal of this project is to keep my C code well-structured and easily accessible for future reference or reuse in other projects.

Sure! Here's a clear list of features based on your description, suitable for including in the README:

### ✨ Features

* 📂 **Program Navigation Menu**
  Provides a simple and interactive menu to help users navigate and select specific C programs.

* ▶️ **Program Execution**
  Runs the selected C program directly from the library interface.

* ❓ **View Code Option**
  After execution, the user is prompted whether they want to see the source code of the executed program (`Yes/No`).

* 👀 **Code Display**
  If the user selects `Yes`, the corresponding source code is displayed on the screen.

* 🔁 **Continue Browsing Option**
  Once a program has been shown, the library asks if the user wants to continue browsing other programs (`Yes/No`).

* 🚪 **Exit on Demand**
  If the user selects `No`, the program exits gracefully.

* 🧑‍💻 **Personal Use Design**
  Built for personal use to organize, manage, and showcase all C programs in one interactive environment.
